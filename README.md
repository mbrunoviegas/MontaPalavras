# Monta Palavras
This is a project to applcation process in Letras.

The main objective of this process, was get existent words from a input string. Then, comparing each one and check which one has the most value.

For this, I used the Trie Tree data structre and an indirect recursive function to walkthrough it and get all words.

The interface is pretty simple, you must provide a input string and click on the button to generate the most value word and check the remanining letters.
